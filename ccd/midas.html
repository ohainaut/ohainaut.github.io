<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>This is a starter's guide for Midas. Section 1 is for basic interactive
Midas, Section 2 for programming in Midas.
<h1>
0- Generalities</h1>

<p>The official MIDAS page is at <a
href="http://www.eso.org/projects/esomidas/">http://www.eso.org/projects/esomidas</a>;
you will find there a link to the full documentation. You may also
find some useful hints and tips in the <a href="http://www.eso.org/projects/esomidas/midas-faq.html">FAQ</a>.

<p>OK, now you can get started:

<br>inmidas 00 : start midas, session number 00 (should be between 00 and 99)
<br>inmidas -p 01 : start another midas without killing the 1st one ("parallel")
<br>inmidas xx : start Midas without graphical capabilities.
<p>helpmidas : help interface (sometime does not work in LinuX)



<h1>
1- Basic Midas:</h1>

<h2>
1.1- Unix commands in Midas:</h2>
OK, this is not strictly speaking Midas, but really useful:
<p>Use $ to pass the command to UniX
<blockquote><tt>$ ls</tt>
<br><tt>$ more toto.dat</tt></blockquote>

<p><br>Warning: $ cd will not work as expected ($ starts a shell, in which
the directory is changed, then you exit from the shell and end up in the
original directory!). Use
<blockquote><tt>CHANGE/DIR ../toto</tt>
<p>(warning for those using my login.prg: cd has been aliased to chan/dir,
which is why it works as one though it should, but as it should not if
it had not been redifined).</blockquote>

<h2>
1.2- Command conventions</h2>

<ul>
<li>
commands are not case sensitive:</li>

<ul><tt>LOAD/IMAGE = load/image</tt></ul>

<li>
commands and parameters can be abreviated as much as possible:</li>

<ul><tt>LOAD/IMAGE toto.bdf scale=full cuts=force,ihap</tt></ul>
is the same as
<ul><tt>loa toto sc=fu cu=f,i</tt></ul>

<li>
all commands have a mini-help:</li>

<ul><tt>LOAD/IMAGE ??</tt></ul>

<li>
all commands have a long help:</li>

<ul>HELP LOAD/IMA</ul>
You can also use
<ul>HELP</ul>
to get a list of commands, or
<ul>HELP LOAD</ul>
to get a list and short help of all the LOAD/* commands, or
<ul>HELP/QUALI IMAGE</ul>
to get a list of all the */IMA commands.
<p>In the generic HELP, you will see that there are several&nbsp; topics
between [brakets]; these are general help about these topics. I recomment
specially HELP [DESCRIPTORS]</ul>

<ul>
<li>
In a command, parameters can be replaced by a default value using ?</li>

<ul>STAT/IMA ? cursor</ul>
the 1st parameter is left as default</ul>

<h2>
1.3- Read images in</h2>
Images usually come in FITS (toto.fits or toto.mt); midas _can_ deal with
FITS frames, but it is usually a good idea to translate the FITS into midas'
internal format, BDF:
<blockquote><tt>INDISK toto.fits toto.bdf</tt></blockquote>
(note that FITS is universally standard, but BDF changes from machine to
machine, from midas version to midas version: NEVER archive BDF files).
<p>As we are playing with images:
<blockquote><tt>OUTDISK toto.bdf toto.fits</tt></blockquote>
will convert an image from BDF to FITS.
<p>Note that these commands also work on tables stored in FITS:
<blockquote><tt>INDISK toto.fits toto.tbl</tt>
<br><tt>OUTDISK toto.tbl toto.fits</tt></blockquote>

<h2>
1.4- play with images</h2>
Once you have an image you can look at it:
<blockquote>
<li>
<tt>CREATE/DISPLAY</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creates a display
window to look at images</li>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<tt>LOAD/IMAGE toto.bdf</tt></li>

<br>or with additional parameters:
<br><tt>LOAD/IMAGE toto.bdf cuts=100,1000 scale=-3 center=500,500</tt>
<blockquote>cuts: min and max of the color scale
<br>scale: positive to zoom in, negative to zoom out
<br>center: the pixel of the image set at the center of the display.</blockquote>
These come with more fancy options:
<br><tt>LOAD/IMA toto cu=f,i sc=fu ce=ce</tt>
<blockquote>cu=f,i: forces the minimum just below the mean of the image,
the max
<br>well above the mean. Works well on images
<br>sc=fu: adjust the scale to see the whole image
<br>ce=ce: center the center of the image</blockquote>
</blockquote>
Note that once the parameters are set, they are remembered for the considered
image; next time, it is enough to do LOAD/IMA toto to reload it as the
last time.
<ul>
<li>
GET/CURSOR</li>

<br>will give you a cursor to measure X,Y and level of a pixel in an image.
Click Mouse-left to measure, Mouse-middle to exit.</ul>

<blockquote>Note that the XY coordinates are given in 2 coordinate systems:
<ul>
<li>
"pixel coordinates": first pixel is 1,1, and they increase by 1 per pixel</li>

<li>
"world coordinates": a more complex coordinate system. Two cases are possible:</li>

<ul>
<li>
simple image: x_world = (x_pixel -1) * x_STEP + x_START (and same for y),
where STEP adn START are descriptors of&nbsp; the image. For example, on
SuSI and EMMI (and many La Silla instruments), START is the first pixel
of the window of the CCD,&nbsp; and STEP is the binning of the CCD. In
that case, x,y_pixel are the number of the pixel of the image you work
on, and x,y_world correspond to the "real" pixel of the physical CCD, no
matter which window and bin are set.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>As a consequence, if bin=1 and the whole CCD is read out, world=pixel</ul>

<ul>
<li>
World Coordinate System (WCS), e.g. for SofI and many instruments on the
VLT: a more complex rule is set to convert the x,y_pixel into x,y_world
so that x,y_world are the actual RA, Dec of the pixel.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><br>As a convention in Midas, "world" x,y are typed as simple numbers,
e.g. 123,456, while "pixel" x,y are typed with the @ symbol, e.g. @123,@456.
So, in the LOAD/IMA example above, we centered the image on world coordinates
500,500, which may or may not be the same as @500,@500.
<p>While the pixel coordinates of a pixel can change if you do something
to an image (e.g. crop it), its world coordinates will always be preserved
whatever you do (unless of course you mess around with the START and STEP).</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
STATISTICS/IMAGE</li>

<br>will make a statistics of the pixel level of the whole image that is
displayed. Very useful: the mean, the standard deviation, the median...
<br>Click Mouse-left to measure, Mouse-middle to exit.</ul>

<ul>STAT/IMA toto.bdf
<br>you can specify another image (not necessarilly displayed)
<p>STAT/IMA ? cursor
<br>you can specify that you want the statistics of only a sub-region.
Measure with Mouse-left, exit with Mouse-middle
<p>Beware of combining both:
<br>STAT/IMA toto cursor
<br>can give rather stupid results as you define the region on the image
that is displayed, and you measure on toto.bdf, which might be another
image!\
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
CENTER/GAUSS</li>

<br>this will give you the center and FWHM (in world unit) of the stars
you click. Click Mouse-left to measure, Mouse-middle to exit.
<br>In the same familly, you have
<br>CENTER/IQE (Image Quality Estimator), which fits a 2D gaussian to the
image and return the axis and position angle (useful for elongated stars),
and
<br>CENTER/MOMENT, which computes the barycenter of the object (useful
for blobs)
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
READ/DESCRIPTOR toto</li>

<br>will read the basic descriptors (i.e. FITS keyword of the frame) of
the image.</ul>

<blockquote>READ/DES toto *
<br>will read _all_ the descriptors (there might be many...)
<p>READ/DES toto ESO.INS.FILT1.NAME
<br>will read one of the descriptor
<p>Some useful ones:
<br>O_TIME contains the date of the image in different formats and the
exposure time
<br>O_POS contains the RA and Dec (in degrees, although some telescope
store this in hours and deg, which is wrong...)
<br>START the world coordinates of the first pixel (usually the first pixel
of a subwindow defined to read the CCD).
<br>STEP the size a pixel in world coordinates (usually the bin of the
CCD)</blockquote>

<h2>
1.5 Arithmetics with images</h2>

<blockquote><tt>COMP/IMA toto.bdf = ( image - bias ) / flat / 900.</tt></blockquote>
will do exactly what it seems it will do: make the difference between image
and bias, divide the result by flat, and finally divide the result by number
900.
<p>Some notes:
<ul>
<li>
there must be a space before and after the =</li>

<li>
you can mix images and numbers</li>

<li>
images can have different sizes (the result will have the size of the intersection
of all the images), but they must have the same STEP.</li>

<li>
many functions are defined, look into the help.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
1.6 Catalogues</h2>
A catalogue is an ASCII file that contains a list of stuff. There are 3
kinds:
<ul>
<li>
image catalogues: ICAT, containing a list of bdf files (or fits, or bdf.gz
compressed images)</li>

<li>
table catalogues: TCAT, containing tables</li>

<li>
ASCII catalogues: ACAT, containing ascii files (typically other catalogues,
or whatever...)</li>
</ul>

<p><br>These are really usefull, as many commands can be executed on a
whole catalogue. In the example below, I use only ICATs, but it works the
same for the others:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
CREATE/ICAT oli toto*bdf</li>

<br>creates a catalogue oli.cat with all the frames that match toto*bdf
(just like in a Unix ls command)</ul>

<ul>
<li>
READ/ICAT oli</li>

<br>reads the catalogue</ul>
<b>Notes:</b>
<br>catalogues are just ASCII files. You can edit them with Emacs (or whatever
editor). It is often simpler to do
<br>CREA/ICA oli *bdf then to remove the lines you don't need than to make
a very accurate CREA/ICA oli ONT*21T23*bdf,ONT*22T00*bdf...
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
EXECUTE/CATALOGUE LOAD/IMA oli.cat sc=fu</li>

<br>The command after EXEC/CAT will be executed for all the images contained
in the catalogue.
<p>Note that you can NOT create new files with different names: this will
NOT work as you could think it would.
<br>EXEC/CAT comp oli_new.cat = oli.cat / 1000.
<br>To do that, you should use a small procedure, c.f. STOR/FRAM in Section
2.</ul>

<h2>
1.7 Tables</h2>
Tables are really very powerful. The can be created
<ul>
<li>
From a data file:</li>

<br>CREATE/TABLE mytable 5 1000 myfile
<br>(you may need to use a format file, cf HELP CREA/TAB)
<li>
From another Midas command, eg</li>

<br>CENT/GAU ? out_table</ul>
Some useful commands:
<blockquote>
<li>
READ/TABLE toto&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reads the whole table</li>

<br>READ/TABLE toto @1 #1 #2 #3&nbsp; reads only line 1, columns Nr 1,
2 and 3
<br>READ/TABLE toto :xcent :ycent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reads only
columns named :xcent and :ycent, all the lines.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
COMP/TAB toto :out&nbsp; = :x + :y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arithmetics;
there are many pre-defined functions, cf HELP COMP/TAB</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
SELECT/TABLE toto :xcent .ge. 0.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will select the lines
for which the condition is true</li>

<br>SELECT/TABLE toto all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; re-select the whole table.
Note that a COMP/TAB reselects the whole table too
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
SORT/TAB toto :x&nbsp; :y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sort&nbsp; the table along
:x, then :y. Be careful when doing a sort on a SELECTed table, then reading
out the result. May be better to re-do the SELECT</li>
</blockquote>

<h2>
1.999 The end</h2>
At this point, you should be able to survive in front a Midas terminal,
and even to convince Midas to do what you want to do on an image. Next
section is for doing the same thing on many images (cf "Error is human,
you need a computer program to really screw things up").
<p>Oh, yes. In case you did not find out, the command to exit is
<blockquote>QUIT</blockquote>
or
<blockquote>BYE</blockquote>
or
<blockquote>EXIT</blockquote>

<h1>
2. Basic Midas procedures</h1>

<h2>
2.1 Intro</h2>
It can be *very* useful to make small Midas procedures, even for beginners.
Basically, just put a few commands in a file, and it is already a procedure.
Be bold, try it. The only think you risk is to wipe the data from your
disk, but you would need to do something really stupid for that to happen.
<p>Midas procedures are expected to have the .prg extension, and they are
called using @@:
<blockquote><tt>@@ example 1234 toto.bdf out.fits</tt></blockquote>
will call example.prg, passing 1234, toto.bdf and out.fits as parameters.
<p>The procedures are looked for
<br>- first in the local directory
<br>- second in the ~/midwork directory
<p>Note that comments are marked with ! :
<blockquote><tt>LOAD/IMA toto.bdf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; !
everything after a ! is a comment</tt></blockquote>

<h2>
2.2 Variables</h2>

<h3>
2.2.1 Global and local</h3>

<ul>
<li>
All variables _must_ be declared.</li>

<li>
All variables are considered as "vectors", with n elements, the first one
not necessarilly being number 1 (it can be any arbitrary number).</li>

<li>
Variables can be Integer, Real, Double precision or Characters.</li>
</ul>
The definition will look like
<blockquote>variable/type/first_element/number_of_elements</blockquote>

<p><br>Local variables are known only inside the procedure, while global
variables (called keywords) are known everywhere.
<br>Use global variables only when needed, because
<br>- the total space for global variable is limited (big, but limited)
<br>- once defined, you have to keep the definition compatible (i.e. if
you define i as global integer, you cannot redefine it later as real, unless
you DELETE/KEY i first)
<ul>
<li>
Local variables:</li>

<br><tt>DEFINE/LOCAL olinteg/i/1/5 0,1,2,3,4</tt>
<br>olinteg will be a local vector of 5 integers, the first one is Nr 1.
The values are initialized.</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Global keywords</li>

<br><tt>WRIT/KEY olireal/r/1/1 0.</tt>
<br>define and initialize a real, global variable</ul>

<h3>
2.2.2 Parameters</h3>
The parameters are special case of variable:
<ul>
<li>
they are called P1, P2, ... P8</li>

<li>
their values are set from the parameter of the procedure</li>

<li>
they are defined/initialized with</li>

<ul>DEFI/PAR Px default type "query string"</ul>
Px: the parameter, e.g. p1,
<br>default: value to be used if it is not given when
<br>type: I (image), T (table), N (number, any type), C (character); an
error will be issued if the type does not match,
<br>"Query string": something that is displayed on the screen to tell you
what to enter if the parameter is not defined (note that if you give a
default, this will never be the case)</ul>
Examples:
<blockquote><tt>DEFI/PAR P1 oli.cat C "input catalogue"</tt>
<br><tt>DEFI/PAR P2 ? N "size" ! note that no default is given</tt>
<br><tt>DEFI/PAR P3 ? ? "something" ! type is free</tt></blockquote>

<h3>
2.2.3 Variable substitution</h3>
(tricky and important. In case you were wondering about a coffee, it is
a good time to have it NOW)
<p>In a procedure, you can use a variable either DIRECTLY, as in
<blockquote><tt>COMP/KEY result = toto1 + toto2</tt></blockquote>
in that case, the variable is used with its full precision, or use its
SUBSTITUTED VALUE, putting it between {}, as in
<blockquote><tt>COMP/KEY result = {toto1} + {toto2}</tt></blockquote>
In that later case, the {toto1} is first substituted using the current
format, and THAT value is used.
<p>As a general rule:
<ul>
<li>
if you compute something, as in COMP/KEY, use the variables directly:</li>

<ul>COMP/KEY result = toto1 + toto2</ul>

<li>
if you use a variable in a non-computing command, use its substituted value:</li>

<ul>LOAD/IMA toto.bdf cuts={toto1},{toto2}</ul>
</ul>
Example: toto.prg
<blockquote><tt>DEFI/LOC toto1/r/1/1 1.001</tt>
<br><tt>DEFI/LOC toto2/r/1/1 2.002</tt>
<br><tt>DEFI/LOC result/r/1/1 0</tt>
<br><tt>result = toto1 + toto2 -3 ! note that COMP/KEY is implicit</tt>
<br><tt>READ/KEY result</tt>
<p><tt>SET/FORM f5.2</tt>
<br><tt>result = {toto1} + {toto2} -3</tt>
<br><tt>READ/KEY result</tt></blockquote>

<blockquote>Midas 011: @@ toto</blockquote>

<blockquote><tt>keyword: RESULT type: real no_elems: 1 modtime: 1003791723</tt>
<br><tt>0.00300014</tt>
<br><tt>keyword: RESULT type: real no_elems: 1 modtime: 1003791723</tt>
<br><tt>0</tt></blockquote>

<blockquote>The first COMP/KEY was executed in full precision, the second
in the precision of the format!</blockquote>

<p><br>(note that {toto} used to be written 'toto' - you might still find
it in old programs; it is obsolete, as you cannot nest them, as in {toto{i}}
)
<p>The format is defined as in FORTRAN, with the following syntax:
<blockquote><tt>SET/FORM </tt>Format_for_integer format_for_real,format_for_double_precision</blockquote>
(note the , ), e.g.
<blockquote><tt>SET/FORM I5 F5.2,E15.5</tt></blockquote>

<h2>
2.2.4 Special functions:</h2>
Many functions exist in Midas. Their name is always M$SOMETHING, where
SOMETHING is what you would expect, eg
<p><tt>M$ABS(arg) M$LN, M$LOG10, M$EXP, M$SIN, M$COS, M$TAN(arg), M$SQRT,
M$ASIN, M$ACOS and M$ATAN(arg)</tt>
<p>Some special functions are also defined, e.g. M$EXIST(arg) returns 1/0,
if file contained in character key `arg'&nbsp; exists or not. There are
many M$EXIST* functions, most of then useful. Refer to HELP COMP/KEY for
complete description
<p>NOTE that many of the math functions (e.g. M$LOG) also have a counter-part
for images,
<blockquote><tt>COMP/IMA res = log(ima)</tt></blockquote>
or for tables,
<blockquote><tt>COMP/TAB table :res = log(:input)</tt></blockquote>
In those cases, there is no M$, which is only for keywords (what do you
mean, "confusing"? M$ is only for keywords, not for tables nor images.
Simple).
<h2>
2.3 Structures</h2>

<h3>
2.3.1 IF</h3>
<b>General structure:</b>
<blockquote>IF something .condition. something THEN
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; write/out "it is true"
<br>ELSE
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; write/out "it is false"
<br>ENDIF</blockquote>
.condition. is like in FORTRAN: .le. .lt. .eq. .ge. .gt. .ne.
<p>ELSE can be ommitted.
<p><b>Example</b>:
<blockquote>if <tt>clei .eq. 4 then</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; write/out "Loading result..."</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; load/ima 'p1'</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; clea/ch ov</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; clei = 0</tt>
<br><tt>else</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; write/out "not loading yet"</tt>
<br><tt>endif</tt></blockquote>
Same remark than above about substituted and direct use of the variables;
the condition above could be written
<blockquote>IF {clei} .EQ. 4 THEN</blockquote>
or even
<blockquote>IF "{clei}" .EQ. "0004" THEN</blockquote>
assuming format set to I4).
<h3>
2.3.2 DO</h3>
<b>General structure:</b>
<blockquote>DO variable = start end step
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; write/out {variable}
<br>ENDDO</blockquote>
Note that
<br>- the start end step are separated by spaces,
<br>- step can be ommitted, and is set to 1 by default.
<br>- step=0 is OK and corresponds to an infinite loop
<br>- the loop is always execute at least once!
<p>Example:
<blockquote><tt>DO LL = 22 OUTPUTI(4) -2</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WRITE/OUT {LL}</tt>
<br><tt>ENDDO</tt></blockquote>

<p><br>(do I still need to make a remark about substituted variables?)
<h3>
2.3.3 GOTO</h3>

<p><br>Goto is quite useful (I don't want to hear comments about GOTOs
being unelegant, outdated, etc... the ARE useful). The command is
<blockquote><tt>GOTO LABEL</tt></blockquote>
Where LABEL is a label located somewhere else, marked with :, as in:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt>again:</tt>
<br><tt>! ( note the : after again: this is a label )</tt>
<br><tt>... ! some other stuff</tt>
<p><tt>if i .ge. 0 then</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goto again:</tt>
<br><tt>endif</tt></blockquote>
which simulate a DO-WHILE loop.
<h3>
2.3.4 Catalogue loops</h3>
If you want to loop on all the frames contained in a catalogue,
<br>STORE/FRAME is what you need. From the help:
<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br><tt>STORE/FRAME key frame [indx] [exit_label]</tt>
<br>key = name of keyword where frame or catalog entry will be stored in
<br>frame = name of frame (syntax = nnnnn) (a)
<br>or
<br>name of catalog (syntax = nnnnn.cat) (b)
<br>indx = index into local keyword CATAL, only used with option (b);
<br>defaulted to 1, i.e. use CATAL(1)
<br>exit_label = label to jump to on termination of catalog processing,
<br>only used with option (b)</blockquote>
<b>Example and notes:</b>
<blockquote><tt>DEFINE/LOCAL CATAL/I/1/1 0 ! you NEED it, and it MUST be
called CATAL</tt>
<br><tt>CAT_LOOP: ! label for the beginning of the loop</tt>
<br><tt>STORE/FRAME IN_A astro.cat 1 FINITO</tt>
<br><tt>.... commands using frames stored in key IN_A, eg</tt>
<br><tt>COMP/IMA new_{IN_A} = ({IN_A} - bias)/ff</tt>
<br><tt>LOAD/IMA new_{IN_A} cu=f,i sc=fu</tt>
<br><tt>GOTO CAT_LOOP ! loop the loop</tt>
<p><tt>FINITO: ! jump here when the catalogue is finished</tt>
<br><tt>.... any other commands ....</tt></blockquote>
<b>Notes</b>:
<br>- if STOR/FRA receives a frame (toto.bdf) instead of a catalogue (with
.cat), the loop will be executed once for that frame: great to make procedures
that work both on catalogues and single frames.
<br>- this is much more powerful that the EXEC/CAT: you can create new
frames and play with their names, as in the example.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
2.4 Deal with tables and images</h2>

<h3>
2.4.1 Simple stuff</h3>

<blockquote><tt>COMP/IMA mag_{inima} = -2.5* log10( ({inima} - {bias})/{ff}
) + {ZP}</tt></blockquote>
will be interpretted as
<blockquote><tt>COMP/IMA mag_ntt0012 = -2.5*log10((ntt0012 -bias_night1)/ff_night1)+26.42</tt></blockquote>
(note the combination of images and numbers).
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
2.4.2 Play with descriptors</h3>
To read a descriptor into a variable, you can use COPY/DK (cf the help),
but it is faster and nicer to address directly the header. Let's assume
you want to read in the exposure time of a frame, which is stored in O_TIME(7)
<blockquote><tt>DEFI/LOC exp/r/1/1 0.</tt>
<br><tt>exp = {ima.bdf,O_TIME(7)}</tt></blockquote>
et voila. If the name of the image is in a variable (for instance the parameter
P1), just nest the {}:
<blockquote><tt>exp = {{p1},O_TIME(7)}</tt></blockquote>
Note that this is a case of variable substitution. Beware of the format.
<p>In the case of tables, it is the same trick, but you <b>have</b> to
specify the .tbl extension.
<blockquote><tt>table_length = {{p1}.tbl,TBLCONTR(10)}&nbsp; ! remark:
in this example, P1 is expected to come without the .tbl, so we add it.</tt></blockquote>
Note that TBLCONTR(10) is the length of the table
<h3>
2.4.3 Play with tables</h3>
If you want to address just an element of a table:
<blockquote><tt>x = {table.tbl,:x,@1}</tt></blockquote>
of more fancy:
<blockquote><tt>x = {{myTable},:{myColumn},@{i}}</tt></blockquote>

<p><br>If you want to write in one element:
<blockquote><tt>{myTable},:mjd,@{i} = JD - 250000.5</tt></blockquote>
(note that the left side is NOT surrounded by {}! Go and re-read the section
on variable substitution if it is not clear!)
<h3>
2.4.999 Various tricks</h3>
Many commands output their values in the generic global keywords OUTPUTR,
OUTPUTI, OUTPUTC. READ/KEY these keywords just after executing the command
to see who is who. For instance
<blockquote><tt>stat/ima {p1}</tt>
<br><tt>min = outputr(1)</tt>
<br><tt>max = outputr(2)</tt>
<br><tt>mean = outputr(3)</tt>
<br><tt>sigma = outputr(4)</tt>
<br><tt>median = outputr(7)</tt></blockquote>
In addition to the previous output in OUTPUT*, many commands can output
their results in table, cf the help of CENT/GAU, MAGN/CIR, etc...
<p>In the case of tables: any table has two special columns
<blockquote>SEQ which contains the number of the line (in the current way
of sorting it!)
<br>SEL which is set to 1 if the line is selected, 0 if not. So, if you
want to make an additional selection to something already selected:
<blockquote>SELEC/TAB toto sel.eq.1 .and. :x.le.0.</blockquote>
</blockquote>

More hints can be found in
<blockquote><tt>HELP [BATCHES]</tt></blockquote>

<p><br>Also, remember that the fastest way to program is often to modify
a program that does something vaguely similar to what you want. Look in
~/midwork for inspiration.
