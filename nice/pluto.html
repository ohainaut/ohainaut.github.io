<h2>HIGH RESOLUTION HST IMAGES OF PLUTO AND CHARON</h2>

<h3>At the Edge of the Solar System</h3>

<p>Click <a href="#fig">here to jump to photo.</a></p>

<p>The remote planet Pluto and its moon Charon orbit the Sun at a mean
distance of almost 6,000 million kilometres, or nearly fourty times
farther out than the Earth. During a recent investigation by an
international group of astronomers [1], the best picture ever of Pluto
and Charon [2] was secured with the European Space Agency's Faint
Object Camera at the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows the two
objects as individual disks, and it is likely that further image
enhancement will allow us to see surface features on Pluto.</p>

<h3>A Very Special Pair of Celestial Objects</h3>

<p>Almost all the known facts about these two bodies show that they
are quite unusual: Pluto's orbit around the Sun is much more elongated
and more inclined to the main plane of the Solar System than that of
any other major planet; Charon's orbit around Pluto is nearly
perpendicular to this plane; their mutual distance is amazingly small
when compared to their size; Charon is half the size of Pluto and the
ratio of their masses is much closer to unity than is the case for all
other planets and their moons. Moreover, both are small and solid
bodies, in contrast to the other, large and gaseous planets in the
outer Solar System.</p>

<p>We do not know why this is so. But there is another important
aspect which makes Pluto and Charon even more interesting: at this
very large distance from the Sun, any evolutionary changes happen very
slowly. It is therefore likely that Pluto and Charon hold important
clues to the conditions that prevailed in the early Solar System and
thus to the origin and the evolution of the Solar System as a
whole.</p>

<h3>Long and Difficult Analysis Ahead</h3>

<p>The present image shows that the overall quality of the new data
obtained with the ESA Faint Object Camera on the refurbished Hubble
Space Telescope is extremely good.  However, such an image represents
only the first step of a subsequent, detailed analysis with the
ultimate goal of determining the physical properties of the two
bodies, first of all their composition, surface structure and possible
atmospheres.</p>

<p>The analysis of data from a facility as complex as the Hubble Space
Telescope is very demanding, and involves experts in many different
fields: planetary astronomy, instrument technology, numerical image
restoration, and spacecraft engineering. It is therefore not
surprising that this investigation is expected to last a long time
yet.</p>

<p>However, while still in its preliminary stages, it
already now appears to indicate the presence of areas
of different reflectivity on the surface of Pluto. By
a comparison of HST images obtained at two different
wavelengths (i.e., in ultraviolet and visual light),
the team members hope that it will become possible to
construct rough maps of the planetary surface and
perhaps also to answer the long-standing question of
whether or not there is an atmosphere around Pluto.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>[1] This investigation is carried out at the Space
    Telescope European Coordinating Facility, which is
    located at the European Southern Observatory as
    part of a collaboration with the European Space
    Agency, and also involves other institutes in Europe
    and the U.S.A.  The team of astronomers is headed by
    Rudolf Albrecht (ST-ECF), and includes Hans-Martin
    Adorf and Richard Hook (ST-ECF), Alessandra Gemmo and
    Olivier Hainaut (ESO), Cesare Barbieri and Gabriele
    Corrain (Osservatorio Astronomico di Padova, Italy),
    Chris Blades, Perry Greenfield and William Sparks
    (Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore,
    Maryland, U.S.A.) and David Tholen (Institute for
    Astronomy, University of Hawaii, U.S.A.).</p>

<p>Hubble Portrait of the "Double Planet"
Pluto & Charon</p>

<p>This is the clearest view yet of the distant planet Pluto and its
moon, Charon, as revealed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The
image was taken by the European Space Agency's Faint Object Camera on
February 21, 1994, when the planet was 4,400 million kilometres from
the Earth; or nearly 30 times the separation between the Earth and the
Sun.</p>

<p>The HST corrected optics show the two objects as clearly separate
and sharp disks. This now allows astronomers to measure directly (to
within about 1 percent) Pluto's diameter of 2320 kilometres and
Charon's diameter of 1270 kilometres.</p>

<p>The HST observations show that Charon is bluer than Pluto. This
means that the worlds have different surface composition and
structure. A bright highlight on Pluto indicates that it may have a
smoothly reflecting surface layer.</p>

<p>A detailed analysis of the HST image also suggests that there is a
bright area parallel to the equator of Pluto. However, subsequent
observations are needed to confirm is this feature is real.</p>

<p>Though Pluto was discovered in 1930, Charon was not detected until
1978.  This is because this moon is so close to Pluto that the two
world's are typically blurred together when viewed through
ground-based telescopes. The new HST image was taken when Charon was
near its maximum elongation from Pluto (0.9 arcseconds). The two
worlds are 19,640 kilometres apart.</p>
