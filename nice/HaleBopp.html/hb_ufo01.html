<h1>Comet Hale-Bopp and its "mysterious unidentified companions"</h1>
<!---=====================================================--->


<!---=====================================================--->
<h3>1. The original "Saturn-like object"</h3>
<!---=====================================================--->
</center>

<p> Several messages have been published on sci.astro and other places
announcing that a Saturn-like companion was orbiting around Hale-Bopp,
"proving that Hale-Bopp is an alien spacecraft heading toward the Earth".

<p> Here is the famous picture (on the left, image obtained and sent
on the net by Chuck Shramek). It is a decent picture of Hale Bopp,
nicely showing its jets.  I rotated the original image to set North up
and East left, to compare it to a portion of the Digital Sky Survey
(right, a scan of an old plate take at the Palomar observatory in
1954). I marked a few common stars, and plotted the path of the comet.

<p> The "mysterious object", marked by "1", is a commons 9th magnitude
star, as there are MANY in the sky!  (SAO 141894 = PPM 180171 = gsc
5086 361, Spectral type M, Coordinates: 17h 49min 33.3sec -2deg 13'
45.4" (eqx 2000)). Some people have remarked that the star looks
brighter in the amateur image than on the Palomar survey: this
reflects the fact that this star is a cold M type, emitting most of
its light in the red and infrared, where the CCD used for the "UFO"
image is much more sensitive than the plates used at Palomar.


<p> Mr.Shramek claims that the software he used to obtain a map of that
region of the sky did not show that star. The problem is that he did
not set up his software properly. Moreover, that close approach
between the comet and this star was <b>predicted</b>: Ovidiu
VADUVESCU, from the Astronomical Institute of the Romanian Academy
Bucharest, publishes a list of <i>"Appulses by PPM Stars of the Comet
C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp)"</I>, that can be found on various WWW servers
(e.g. at <a
href="http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/halebopp/plans/appulses.txt">
University of Maryland"</a>; a local copy is available <a
href="appulses.txt">here</a>).

<p>While an error like this one can happen to the best observer, it
seems that Ch.Shramek refuses to admit that he made a mistake and keeps
claiming that SAO 141894 is following the comet (c.f. discussion on
going on sci.astro). <i>(update - Dec.24, 1996: Ch.Shramek's 
<a href="http://www.NeoSoft.com/~cshramek/">home page</a> is working
again; see for yourself...)</I> 

<p>More details about this story, including the original messages
posted on the net, can be found on <a
href=http://www.halebopp.com/slo1.htm>The SLO Files</a> of the
www.haleBopp.com site.

<h3> 2. More Saturn-like objects</h3>
<!---=====================================================--->
</center>

Since the original re-discovery of SAO 141894 by Shramek, almost
anything around Hale-Bopp has been reported as UFOs.  This situation
is not really surprising: if someone shows me an X-Ray of a human
head, I will probably be able to identify that it is a skull, but I
could certainly not say if it is normal, if there is a brain tumor, or
more generally say anything useful about this X-ray (hey! I'm an
astronomer, not an X-ray doctor!). If I declared that the person whose
head is on the picture has a terrible disease that is "clearly
visible" on the X-Ray, that claim would be valueless: nobody would
believe it, and if the person really had a brain tumor, it would
certainly be unrelated to what I saw on the X-ray.

<p>The situation is the same for Hale-Bopp: CCD images are now very
easy to obtain, but many of those who analyze them don't have the
knowledge/education/experience to do so. The two pages linked below
constitute a short summary of CCD imaging analysis:
<ul> 
<li><a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~hainaut/ccd/CCD_proc.html">
    Basic image processing</a>: the steps that an image undergoes
    between the telescope and a WWW browser.
<li><a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~hainaut/ccd/CCD_artifacts.html">
    Common CCD artifacts</a>: how to determine if what you see on an
    image is from outer space or is inside the CCD.
</ul>

<p> Below is a table of "UFOs" obtained from the net, and a short
description of what actually is the feature described as unusual.

      <td> The comet has an appearance compatible with the time stamp
         indicated on the image. However, the background stars do not
         seem match with that date. 

	 <p>The object seems elongated horizontally, which is
	 difficult to explain (assuming the image has not been
	 doctored). At this point, it is really hard to say anyting

	 <p><i>(Update Jan.1, 1997)</I> A

	 <li>"The HBST image does not appear to be a Hubble Space

         <li>The HBST image does not match any optical star field of

         <li>Proclamations of the image as ‘evidence’ of a
 	     ‘companion object’ are unfounded based on the 
             data provided. 
	 </ul>    
         Without more information, no other conclusions can be

	 appears to be misinformation. Ron"</i>
