<p>This image (larger <a

 of Comet Hale-Bopp was obtained on September 16, 1996 at
the <a href="http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/"> Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope on Mauna Kea </a>, with the 8192^2 pixel CCD camera built by
the <a href="http://galileo.ifa.hawaii.edu/ifa/ifa.html"> Institute
for Astronomy</a> (Hawaii); the observers were Olivier Hainaut, Karen
Meech and James Bauer.

<p>The camera, which is the largest in the world, is a mosaic of 8
CCDs, each one having 2048x4096 pixels. The gaps between these
detectors appears as a black grid. Some defects in some of the CCDs
appear as black streaks. As a comparison, a typical large professional
CCD has 2000 pixels (i.e., half of one of the individual chips), and
amateur CCDs usually have less than 1000pix. This camera allow us to
obtain images of a huge field without any loss of resolution: on the
CFHT, the field of view is almost 1/2 x 1/2 degree (the full Moon
would just fit in), i.e. about 10-40 times larger than what is
obtained with typical CCD detectors.

<p>This image is a 2min exposure through a VR filter (very broad-band,
enclosing most of the visible light from green to red), except the
central region (saturated on the 2min exposure), which was extracted
from a 15sec image taken just after. On this image, N is up, E is
left. At the time of the observations, the Sun was on the right side
of the image (almost 2deg up from W). At least 6 dust jets are visible
close to the nucleus (they have been slightly enhanced by dividing the
image by a smooth cometary profile); they curve away from the Sun, as
the solar wind drags the dust particles, to fade into the huge
tail. Images obtained by S. Larson and his collaborators a few days
before and after this frame show the same jets in exactly the same
position, indicating that the comet nucleus did not rotate during this
period; the period of rotation must be very long. M. Festou observed
the jets spectroscopically about 2 weeks before this image was
taken. His data show that the particle in the jets are moving toward
us, which is what was expected: as the jets are emitted from the
Sun-facing hemisphere, and the Earth is between the Sun and the comet,
we see the jets pointing toward us.  The comet was at 3.1 AU from the
Sun, which means that the water ice constituting most of its nucleus
is now receiving just enough heat from the Sun in order to sublimate,
while during the past months, only other ices (like CO and CO2 ices,
which require less heat to sublimate) were contributing to the comet's
activity.
