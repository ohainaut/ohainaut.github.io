<p> This image of Comet Hale-Bopp was obtained on Nov. 8, 1996 on the
UH 88" telescope at Mauna Kea by J. Bauer, O.R. Hainaut and
C.C. Petersen (larger version <a href="HaleBopp_nov96.gif">here</a>).
The comet was very low on the horizon, and we took the image through
some clouds just a few minutes before we had to close the dome because
of high humidity.

<p> The detector is a huge CCD mosaic, composed of 8 individual
chips; the thick black lines correspond to the gaps between them.
This short "R" exposure has been processed in order to enhance the
jets.
