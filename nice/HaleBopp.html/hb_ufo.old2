<h1>Comet Hale-Bopp and its "mysterious unidentified companions"</h1>
<!---=====================================================--->
</center>

There has been a lot of trafic and questions on the Net about an
object following comet Hale-Bopp. <p>

To answer them shortly, there is not one single evidence that the
comet might be accompanied by any other object, natural or artificial.

<ul> <li> On January 15, 1997, a new <a
href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/images/hale-bopp/tholen-sep1/">"UFO" picture</a> was posted on Art Bel's 
and Whitley Strieber's web sites. We have identified that image as
being a fake based on an image obtained by an astronomer of the
Institute for Astronomy, Dr. Dave Tholen.

<p><b>A <a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/images/hale-bopp/tholen-sep1/hb_ufo_tholen.html#stat">statement</a>  has been issued about
this fraud</b> (in HTML format with figures).

<p>Dr. Brown (who send the hoax to Bell and Strieber) claims he
received the original photo on film rolls. This is impossible since
the original photo were obtained digitally.  <a
href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/images/hale-bopp/tholen-sep1/hb_ufo_tholen.html#brown">
More details, including the <b>real, raw images directly from the
telescope</b></a>, are available on this site.


<p><li> A table of <a href="hb_ufo_list.html">all the photos</a>
showing alleged UFOs around Hale-Bopp is available, with detailed
explanation of what caused these identified "UFOs"; I also included
some information on <a
href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~hainaut/ccd/CCD_proc.html">basic
image processing</a> and on the
<a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~hainaut/ccd/CCD_artifacts.html">typical CCD
camera artifacts</a>.
</ul>

<p>More details can be found on the <a
href=http://www.halebopp.com/slo1.htm>The SLO Files</a> of the
www.haleBopp.com site.
Sky and Telescope has also published an 
<a href="http://www.skypub.com/comets/slo.html">article</a> about this.

<p><b>Concluding remarks:</b> Comet Hale-Bopp is a <i>bright</i>
object; it is becoming visible again, and will become easier and
easier to see in the coming weeks. <a
href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/images/hale-bopp/maps.html"> Map and
ephemerides</a> are available on this site: go and enjoy this nice comet!
