<p>20 January 1997 

<p>To Whom It May Concern, 

<p>It is with both great concern and enthusiasm that I address all of
you today who are willing to listen to me. I, and many of my
colleagues here at The Farsight Intitutute, have learned a great deal
these past weeks. Though many of you have been following the recent
events surrounding the Institute, much of what I report below will be
new to most of you. Let me explain.  

<p>To begin with a re-cap of the events of the past weeks, in late
1996, I reported on a series of remote viewing sessions that were
conducted here at The Farsight Institute. This report was made live on
the Art Bell radio talk show. The substance of the remote viewing
sessions was the apparent object that was following the comet
Hale-Bopp. The remote viewing results clearly suggest that the object
was artificial in nature, and that it was under intelligent
control. The summaries of these sessions can be found at our Web site,
http://www.farsight.org. The targeting of this object was a
consequence of a photograph taken of the object (which was released on
the same day as our remote viewing sessions) by the amateur
astronomer, Chuck Shramek. To target the object with our remote
viewing sessions, we did not use Shramek's photo. Rather, we used the
verbal cue, "Anomalous object near Hale-Bopp comet (current time)."
Immediately before assigning the target to our professional remote
viewers, we at the Institute made some phone calls to professional
contacts we had in the astronomical community to ascertain whether
there indeed was any knowledge of such an object. We received an
affirmative response from one astronomer who talked to our Webmaster.

<p>About one week after my appearance on the Art Bell show, the
astronomer mentioned above called us and told us that he had received
other information about the object. When asked by us, he offered to
send us some photographs of the object that he had obtained. At the
time, we felt certain that the photographs were his, or were at least
under his control. He also said he had other information relating to
the object, including a recording of a radio transmission originating
from the object. He did not offer to share this other information with
us, and we did not ask for it. We were eager to obtain physical
confirming evidence of our remote viewing sessions that could be seen
as a form of scientific feedback. The astronomer sent us three rolls
of film that we then developed. Two of the rolls were blank when
developed. But the other roll had five very good astronomical
photographs, unevenly placed along the film strip. The photos clearly
showed the comet as well as the companion object. When the photos were
sent to us, the astronomer asked us to share them only with our inner
group, and never to associate his name with them. He also mentioned
that he hoped to have a news conference within one week pertaining to
the evidence that was being gathered and analyzed.  

<p>After receiving the three undeveloped rolls of film from the
astronomer, we had them developed. I, myself, have personally held and
examined the developed film. Our Webmaster then scanned the images
directly from the black and white negatives into a computer. She
digitally enhanced the images by putting them through a number of
filters. She also enlarged one of the images so as to clearly show the
comet and its companion.  

<p>Soon after receiving the photographs mentioned above, Art Bell
contacted me asking if anything could be done to help Chuck Shramek,
who was under considerable attack from lots of people since he
released his photograph of the comet and its companion. At first I did
not know what to say to Art; we had already presented our remote
viewing results, and that is all we do...remote viewing. But I
remembered the photographs, and I called Art again suggesting that we
could do another radio show where we talked about the pictures, as
long as we agreed not to post or distribute the pictures, nor to talk
about the identity of the astronomer. We sent a copy of one of the
pictures (via email) to Art Bell and Whitley Strieber.  

<p>In the radio interview pertaining to the pictures, I and our
Webmaster clearly stated that the evidence that we had gathered was to
be considered only anecdotally by others until the astronomer had a
chance to come forward with a formal presentation of his
evidence. This photo was not used by The Farsight Institute in any way
with regard to remote viewing targeting. We showed it to Mr. Bell and
Mr. Strieber primarily to assist our radio presentation, which in turn
was primarily motivated to help Mr. Shramek. The photo was never
intended to offer "solid physical proof" of the existence of the
object. It was, minimally, another picture of the comet and its
companion, and it reflected our efforts to try to obtain physical
confirmation of our remote viewing results.  <p>Following this radio
broadcast, a huge public interest in the "mystery astronomer"
developed, in large part stoked by comments that continued to be made
on the radio about the picture. Finally, Art Bell announced that he
would post the picture that was sent to him by us on his Web site. He
did this, despite my strong objections, in mid January. Approximately
24 hours later, Mr. Bell called me and informed me that the photo that
we had sent him was a fraud. He said that the picture was found
(without the Hale-Bopp companion) on a Web site run by the University
of Hawaii. An astronomer at that university apparently sent Mr. Bell a
letter stating that he took the photo, and that it was later digitally
modified to add the companion. The overall implication was that we had
taken the Web image from the Hawaiian Web site and created a
fraudulent image of the companion.  

<p>When I heard about this, I realized that I had made a very crucial
error. I knew that we had an authentic astronomical image that was not
stolen from the Hawaiian Web site. (Remember, I have held the
negatives from which our image was obtained.) Moreover, I do not now,
nor have I ever argued that the Hawaiian image is contrived, or that
anyone at the University was knowingly involved in an effort to
discredit me or The Farsight Institute. Moreover, we have absolutely
no evidence to suggest that the astronomer who gave us the original
images knowingly assisted the attempt to attack us. Also, even if the
images provided to us were doctored, this does not mean that our
astronomer contact knew of this. It would be positively immoral to
disclose this astronomer's identity if he himself were duped.
<p>Those who have attacked us have resources that extend beyond those
of any university or professor. Yes, there are questions. But I do not
have the resources to answer these questions in a way that will be
meaningful to the public and the larger mission of The Farsight
Institute. We were fed an image that someone knew would be attacked if
ever released. That much we do know.  

<p>But the mistake that I made was in trying to combat a wide-scale
and highly organized disinformation campaign using only physical
evidence (e.g., a photo). The result was that I walked right into a
trap. I am glad, in retrospect, to have done so, for I have re learned
a great deal about what we need to be doing, and what we should not be
doing, at The Farsight Institute. Moreover, this lesson has relevance
to all interested individuals and groups across this entire planet.
<p>Disinformation campaigns are not unusual in the area of
extraterrestrial life. There are many powers-that-be that absolutely
do not want this information to be widely accepted in the general
populace at the current time. The magnitude of the disinformation
campaign has been escalating ever since the Roswell UFO crash, and it
certainly continues to this day.  <p>Friends, it was foolish of me to
think that we at The Farsight Institute could hope to combat an
entrenched and continuing disinformation campaign on the basis of
physical evidence. Physical evidence has never been the problem; the
problem has always been that people are too willing to disregard
almost any evidence based on nearly any contrary argument. In our
case, an image nearly identical to our own was found in record time on
a prominent university's Web site.  <p>What should we do? Many of you
may think that we should continue to combat this on the physical
level. You may think that we should try to prove that our image came
from film, and that this image was taken from a telescope, not another
Web site. But friends, while all these facts are true, any effort to
"prove" this would not succeed.  <p>We know that we have never
deceived or lied to the public. But we need to be very careful in how
we respond to what has happened to us. If we try to respond on the
level of only physical evidence, we will be crushed, not because we
are wrong, but because we do not have the resources to win such a
battle compared with those who attack us. The attacks would continue,
and they would get worse in unexpected ways. It simply is not possible
for us to fight our fight on that level.  <p>We now want everyone to
realize that we erred by fighting, even momentarily, on the level of
the display of physical evidence. We are sorry for having done
this. We apologize to those who have supported us for having strayed
from our mission. But in the end, we want to emphasize to all of you
how inconsequential all of this is in the larger picture of things.
<p>At the current time, everyone is focusing on the photo, a photo
that was never used by us for remote viewing targeting. This misses
the point of all that we do and is ultimately not important. We need
to remind everyone that our job at The Farsight Institute is to
demonstrate scientifically to all of us that we humans are more than
our physical bodies, and that life exists on both the physical and
subspace (nonphysical) realms. Focusing on the photo plays right into
the hands of those who want to hinder widespread acknowledgment of our
current condition, as well as our current potential as a species
living in a galaxy that is literally full of life.  <p>We all need to
move to a higher level of awareness. We all need to act from within
that higher level. In order for us to be successful, we simply cannot
continue to act solely on the lower level of physical
manifestation. Indeed, if the extraterrestrials wanted to force the
issue of humanity accepting the existence of extraterrestrial life,
they could simply move one of their large ships into an Earth orbit
and leave it there. The reality is that they are using this cat and
mouse, appearance and disappearance game to help us move to that
higher level of awareness ourselves, without the need for such
psychological force.  <p>Many people think that they know what they
themselves need with regard to scientific evidence that we live not
alone in our universe. But again, the absence of such proof has never
been the problem, and thus, the perceived need is simply incorrect. In
our view, what people really need is the truth about who we are as
humans. People need to know about the new scientific understanding of
our composite nature (two things put together, soul and
body). Finally, people need to know that The Farsight Institute is
dedicated to researching and teaching about our essential nature on
the level of explorations into consciousness.  <p>One day, the
disinformation campaigns that reside on the physical level will
cease. The attacks will come to an end, and we will all realize that
these very attacks were a deep psychological response to the sense of
change that is upon us. Indeed, these attacks reveal a profound level
of stress in the collective consciousness of our human society.  <p>We
are at a turning point in our human evolution. We must all realize
that no one should ever expect our efforts at The Farsight Institute
to devolve to the level of a detective agency that seeks and presents
only physical evidence. We collect and present data obtained using
scientific remote viewing protocols. We demand great accuracy of
ourselves. We seek to demonstrate and continually improve our work. It
is my view that the entire world will soon look objectively at what we
do. Finally, one day nearly everyone will recognize that the great
debate as to who we are and why we exist has been significantly
resolved. This, indeed, is our mission.  <p>A carpenter uses chisels
and hammers. A plumber uses wrenches and torches. Cameras and
telescopes are also good tools, but they are not our tools. Our tools
that we use to accomplish our mission are the tools of
consciousness. It was my mistake that we strayed from the use of
solely these tools. I will not make that mistake again. The stakes are
high for all of humanity. We simply cannot fail in this effort to
raise our own awareness of who we are. Never ask more than that we use
our tools well. And we will never ask less of ourselves.
