<p>There has been a lot of traffic and questions on the Net about an
object following Comet Hale-Bopp.  To answer them shortly, there is no
evidence that the comet might be accompanied by any other object,
natural or artificial.

<p>Here is a short summary of the major events related to Hale-Bopp
alleged companion:

<ul> 
<li><font color="red"><b>November 14, 1996:</b></font> Chuck Shramek
    takes a CCD image of the 
    comet. One of the background stars displays some spikes, giving it
    a "Saturn-like" look. On Art Bell's radio show, Mr.Shramek
    announced this Saturn-Like Object (SLO) to the world. The rumor
    spread on the net that this object was a huge spacecraft (3 times
    as large as the Earth).  The <a
    href="hb_ufo_shramek.html">
    original image</a> is compared to the Palomar Sky Survey, and the
    SLO is identified as star SAO 141894.

<p><li><font color="red"><b>November-December 1996:</b></font> Other
    SLOs were "discovered" in 
    images released on different web sites. In all cases, the SLO was
    identified as a star and/or some CCD artifacts. A <a
    href="hb_ufo_list.html">
    table</a> lists all the "SLO" and companions I heard of, with the
    explanation of the phenomena which caused it. In order to help
    those who are not experience working with CCD images, the two
    pages linked below constitute a short summary of CCD imaging
    analysis techniques:  
    <ul> 
    <li><a href="../ccd/CCD_proc.html">
    	Basic image processing</a>: the steps that an image undergoes
    	between the telescope and a WWW browser.
    <li><a href="../ccd/CCD_artifacts.html">
    	Common CCD artifacts</a>: how to determine if what you see on an
    	image is from outer space or is inside the CCD.
    </ul>

<p><li><font color="red"><b>January 15, 1997:</b></font> a new 
    <a href="tholen-sep1">
    "UFO" picture</a> was posted on Art Bell's and Whitley Strieber's
    web  sites. We have identified that image as being a fake based on
    an image obtained by an astronomer at the University of Hawaii's
    Institute for Astronomy, Dr. David Tholen. 

    <p><b>A <a
    href="tholen-sep1/hb_ufo_tholen.html#stat">statement</a>
    has been issued about this fraud</b> (in HTML format with
    figures). 

    <p>Dr. Brown (who sent the hoax to Bell and Strieber) claims he
    received the original photo on film rolls. This is impossible
    since the original photo were obtained digitally.  <a
    href="tholen-sep1/hb_ufo_tholen.html#brown"> 
    More details, including the <b>real, raw images directly from the
    telescope</b></a>, are available on this site.  


<p><li><font color="red"><b>March 26, 1997:</b></font> Thirty nine
    members of a cult were found dead in their Californian mansion.
    They apparently died in a carefully organized suicide. It seems
    that the victims believed they were going to meet Hale-Bopp's
    companion. I hope they found the peace they were searching, even
    if there was no UFO to meet them.

</ul>

<p>More details can be found on the <a
href=http://www.halebopp.com/slo1.htm>The SLO Files</a> of the
www.halebopp.com site.
Sky and Telescope has also published an 
<a href="http://www.skypub.com/comets/slo.html">article</a> about this.
Brian Monson has written a very intersting <a
href="http://www.physics.utulsa.edu/astronomy/hbmath.html">page</a>
describing  how bright would be a large object at the distance of Hale-Bopp.



<!---<p><font color="red"><b>Concluding remarks:</b></font> Comet Hale-Bopp
<!---is a beautiful and <i>bright</i> object; it is easilly visible. <a
<!---href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/images/hale-bopp/maps.html"> Map and
<!---ephemerides</a> are available on this site.  <B>Enjoy this nice
<!---comet!</B>
