<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Comet Hale-Bopp and its &quot;mysterious unidentified
companions&quot;</H1>

<CENTER><P><!---=====================================================---><!---=====================================================---></P></CENTER>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>1. The original &quot;Saturn-like object&quot;</H3>

<CENTER><P><!---=====================================================---></P></CENTER>

<P>Several messages have been published on sci.astro and other places announcing
that a Saturn-like companion was orbiting around Hale-Bopp, &quot;proving
that Hale-Bopp is an alien spacecraft heading toward the Earth&quot;. </P>

<P>Here is the famous picture (on the left, image obtained and sent on
the net by Chuck Shramek). It is a decent picture of Hale Bopp, nicely
showing its jets. I rotated the original image to set North up and East
left, to compare it to a portion of the Digital Sky Survey (right, a scan
of an old plate take at the Palomar observatory in 1954). I marked a few
common stars, and plotted the path of the comet. </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="hb_ufo.gif" HEIGHT=490 WIDTH=723> </P></CENTER>

<P>The &quot;mysterious object&quot;, marked by &quot;1&quot;, is a commons
9th magnitude star, as there are MANY in the sky! (SAO 141894 = PPM 180171
= gsc 5086 361, Spectral type M, Coordinates: 17h 49min 33.3sec -2deg 13'
45.4&quot; (eqx 2000)). Some people have remarked that the star looks brighter
in the amateur image than on the Palomar survey: this reflects the fact
that this star is a cold M type, emitting most of its light in the red
and infrared, where the CCD used for the &quot;UFO&quot; image is much
more sensitive than the plates used at Palomar. </P>

<P>Mr.Shramek claims that the software he used to obtain a map of that
region of the sky did not show that star. The problem is that he did not
set up his software properly. Moreover, that close approach between the
comet and this star was <B>predicted</B>: Ovidiu VADUVESCU, from the Astronomical
Institute of the Romanian Academy Bucharest, publishes a list of <I>&quot;Appulses
by PPM Stars of the Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp)&quot;</I>, that can be
found on various WWW servers (e.g. at <A HREF="http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/halebopp/plans/appulses.txt">University
of Maryland&quot;</A>; a local copy is available <A HREF="appulses.txt">here</A>).
</P>

<P>While an error like this one can happen to the best observer, it seems
that K.Shramek refuses to admit that he made a mistake and keeps claiming
that SAO 141894 is following the comet (c.f. discussion on going on sci.astro).
</P>

<P>More details about this story, including the original messages posted
on the net, can be found on <A HREF="http://www.halebopp.com/slo1.htm">The
SLO Files</A> of the www.haleBopp.com site. </P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>2. More Saturn-like objects</H3>

<CENTER><P><!---=====================================================--->Since
the original re-discovery of SAO 141894 by Shramek, almost anything around
Hale-Bopp has been reported as UFOs. This situation is not really surprising:
if someone shows me an X-Ray of a human head, I will probably be able to
identify that it is a skull, but I could certainly not say if it is normal,
if there is a brain tumor, or more generally say anything useful about
this X-ray (hey! I'm an astronomer, not an X-ray doctor!). If I declared
that the person whose head is on the picture has a terrible disease that
is &quot;clearly visible&quot; on the X-Ray, that claim would be valueless:
nobody would believe it, and if the person really had a brain tumor, it
would certainly be unrelated to what I saw on the X-ray. </P></CENTER>

<P>The situation is the same for Hale-Bopp: CCD images are now very easy
to obtain, but many of those who analyze them don't have the knowledge/education/experience
to do so. The two pages linked below constitute a short summary of CCD
imaging analysis: </P>

(assuming the image has not been doctored). At this point, it is really
hard to say anyting more about this image based only on the jpeg version:
we really need more information about this observation. </P>

<P><B>Concluding remarks:</B> Comet Hale-Bopp is a <I>bright</I> object.
Go out and observe it yourself! If is everyday closer to the sky, but is
still visible in the evening sky, with a small telescope or even binoculars.
Note that observers at low latitudes (like Hawaii) will have a hard time
spotting the comet in the twilight sky. <A HREF="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/images/hale-bopp/maps.html">Map
