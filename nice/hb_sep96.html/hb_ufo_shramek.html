<h1>The original "Saturn-like object"</h3>
<!---=====================================================--->
</center>

<p> Several messages have been published on sci.astro and other places
announcing that a Saturn-like companion was orbiting around Hale-Bopp,
"proving that Hale-Bopp is an alien spacecraft heading toward the Earth".

<p> Here is the famous picture (on the left, image obtained and sent
on the net by Chuck Shramek). It is a decent picture of Hale Bopp,
nicely showing its jets.  I rotated the original image to set North up
and East left, to compare it to a portion of the Digital Sky Survey
(right, a scan of an old plate take at the Palomar observatory in
1954). I marked a few common stars, and plotted the path of the comet.

<p> The "mysterious object", marked by "1", is a commons 9th magnitude
star, as there are MANY in the sky!  (SAO 141894 = PPM 180171 = gsc
5086 361, Spectral type M, Coordinates: 17h 49min 33.3sec -2deg 13'
45.4" (eqx 2000)). Some people have remarked that the star looks
brighter in the amateur image than on the Palomar survey: this
reflects the fact that this star is a cold M type, emitting most of
its light in the red and infrared, where the CCD used for the "UFO"
image is much more sensitive than the plates used at Palomar.


<p> Mr.Shramek claims that the software he used to obtain a map of that
region of the sky did not show that star. The problem is that he did
not set up his software properly. Moreover, that close approach
between the comet and this star was <b>predicted</b>: Ovidiu
VADUVESCU, from the Astronomical Institute of the Romanian Academy
Bucharest, publishes a list of <i>"Appulses by PPM Stars of the Comet
C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp)"</I>, that can be found on various WWW servers
(e.g. at <a
href="http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/halebopp/plans/appulses.txt">
University of Maryland"</a>; a local copy is available <a
href="appulses.txt">here</a>).

<p>While an error like this one can happen to the best observer, it
seems that Ch.Shramek refuses to admit that he made a mistake and keeps
claiming that SAO 141894 is following the comet (c.f. discussion on
going on sci.astro). <i>(update - Dec.24, 1996: Ch.Shramek's 
<a href="http://www.NeoSoft.com/~cshramek/">home page</a> is working
again; see for yourself...)</I>

posted on the net, can be found on <a
