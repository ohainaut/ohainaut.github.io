<h3> The "Secret Image" </h3>
<!---=====================================================--->

On January 15, 1997, a new "secret UFO picture" was posted on <a
href="http://www.artbell.com">Art Bell</a>'s and <a
href=http://www.strieber.com">Whitley Strieber</a>'s web sites, after
being announced for several days.  They supposedly have received it
through Prudence Calabrese from a "mysterious astrophysicist" who
"preferred to remain anonymous". Below are the original images released
at the two sites above (compressed 2x to save bandwidth).

<p>The original caption of the images (on 
<a href="http://www.strieber.com/ufonews/bopp5.html">Strieber's
site</a>) said:

<blockquote><i>
   The marked-up version identifies the object nestled deep in the
   comet's corona, immediately behind it. The clear version shows the
   same thing without the digital markings. To all appearances this is
   a genuine astronomical photograph, and the very close proximity of
   the object to the comet makes it hard (but not impossible) to claim
   that the object is a star. 
</i></blockquote>


<p>We have identified that image as being a fake based on an image
obtained by an astronomer of the Institute for Astronomy, Dr. Dave
Tholen. The 
<a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/images/hale-bopp/95sep01.gif">
original image</a> has been posted on 
<a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/images/hale-bopp/">our Hale-Bopp
page</a> more than one year ago.

<p>Below is a comparison between the central region of the two images.
The fraudulent image has been rotated to match the orientation of the
original one.

<!---=====================================================--->

 Below is a statement by Dave Tholen, explaining the
why there is absolutely no doubt that the fake image is a doctored
copy of his image.


<blockquote>
<p>Images of comet Hale-Bopp showing an allegedly mysterious companion
object have appeared on web sites with the URLs <a
href=http://www.strieber.com">
http://www.strieber.com/ufonews/bopp5.html </a> and <a
href="http://www.artbell.com">http://www.artbell.com/art/halebopp.html</a>.


<p>These images are fraudulent. The mysterious companion object is not
real, having been added to the image most likely using digital image
processing techniques. The original image appears at a web site with
the URL <a
href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/images/hale-bopp/95sep01.gif">
http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/images/hale-bopp</a>. I took this image on
1995 September 1 using the University of Hawaii 2.24-m telescope
shortly before 6 hours UTC (or about 8 p.m. on August 31 Hawaiian
Standard Time).

<p>There is no doubt that THIS 1995 September 1 image was used for the
fraudulent images:

<ul><li> A careful comparison of the central region of the original
image shows the comet in the same position with respect to the
background stars, which means the real and doctored images must have
been taken at essentially the same time. As such, the images could not
have been taken from eastern Asia or Australia, where the Sun was
still up, nor from western North or South America, where the comet was
very low in the sky.

<li>The images of stars on both show the same amount of sharpness, so
an observatory site capable of providing approximately arcsecond
seeing must have been involved.

<li>The faintest stars visible on both images are essentially the
same, meaning that the combination of telescope aperture and exposure
length must be the same. Given that the stars are not trailed, the
exposures must have been short, meaning that a large telescope must
have been used.

<li>The relative brightnesses of the stars shown are also the same,
meaning that the same filters must have been used and combined into a
single image in the same way.

<li>Lastly, the pixel size is the same.
</ul>

<p>All of which indicates that these are in fact the same
image. Hawaii is the only place with large telescopes that could have
taken the image at the time indicated by the comet's placement among
the stars, and with the degree of sharpness provided by the atmosphere
above the observatory site.  The 2.24-m telescope was the only one on
the mountain equipped with a camera that provided the correct pixel
size, and the only one that used the particular combination of red,
green, and blue filters to produce the original color composite. There
is no doubt about the origin of this image.

<p>The myserious companion object does not appear on the original,
which means it was added to the copy by some unknown individual in an
attempt to deceive the public.

<p>The original images are not secret, as claimed on the first two web
sites mentioned above, having been available on the Institute for
Astronomy's web site since September of 1995, and it has also appeared
on Sky Publishing's web site with permission. The allegedly mysterious
astrophysicist who took the image was never at the point of making a
public announcement to claim discovery of the object; there is no
object for which discovery can be claimed. The identity of the faked
image with the one I took was called to my attention only today, and
this statement was prepared as a rebuttal.
