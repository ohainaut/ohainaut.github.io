        Based on photographic data of the National Geographic Society
        -- Palomar        Observatory Sky Survey (NGS-POSS) obtained
        using the Oschin Telescope on        Palomar Mountain.  The
        NGS-POSS was funded by a grant from the National
        Geographic Society to the California Institute of Technology.
        The              plates were processed into the present
        compressed digital form with             their permission.
        The Digitized Sky Survey was produced at the Space
        Telescope Science Institute under US Government grant NAG
        W-2166.
