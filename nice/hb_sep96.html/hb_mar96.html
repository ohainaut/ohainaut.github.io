<h2>The Near-Nucleus Region of Comet Hale-Bopp</h2>

<p>

<h3>ESO Press Photo 26/96; 22 March 1996</h3>

<br>
A series of CCD frames, showing the inner coma of Comet Hale-Bopp, was
obtained with the SUSI high angular resolution camera at the ESO
3.5-metre New Technology Telescope (NTT) under very good seeing
conditions in the morning of March 20, 1996.

<p>

The photo shows a composite of nine 1-min exposures through a red
filtre. The telescope was set to follow the motion of the comet and
the stars are therefore seen as nine small trails (the intervals
correspond to the time needed for the read-out from the CCD). The
field shown measures about 55 x 55 arcsec across. North is up and East
is left.

<p>

The complex structure is clearly seen, in particular a dust jet which
extends from the nucleus towards North and curves counterclockwise. It
is therefore obvious that the high dust production rates persists.

<p>

At the time of the observation, Comet Hale-Bopp was 5.28 AU from the
Earth (790 million km) and 4.97 AU from the Sun (744 million km). At
this geocentric distance, 1 arcsec = 3830 km projected.

<i> Note: this image has been enhanced using a gentle unsharp masking
to increase the contrast of the coma features. This technique caused
the dark rings around the point sources.
