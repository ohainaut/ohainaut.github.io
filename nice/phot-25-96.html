<h2>Rapid Changes in the Inner Coma of Comet Hyakutake</h2>

<p>

<h3>ESO Press Photo 25a-d/96; 19 March 1996</h3>

The most recent ESO observations of bright Comet Hyakutake have shown
rapid changes in the innermost coma, within a few hundred kilometres
from the cometary nucleus. This result has only become possible because
of the unusual combination of a bright comet being near the Earth,
together with the excellent imaging quality of the ESO 3.5-metre New
Technology Telescope (NTT).

<p>

The images shown here are based on a unique series of fourty-four 2-sec
exposures, obtained under excellent conditions (seeing 0.7 - 0.8
arcsec) in the morning of March 19, 1996 with the SUSI camera at the
ESO NTT at La Silla, Chile. The observers, Olivier Hainaut (Institute
of Astronomy, Honolulu, Hawaii) and Richard West (ESO), were assisted
by Manuel Pizarro (ESO La Silla) and Vicente Reyes (ESO Garching).

<p>

These images were obtained during an observing run in remote control
from the ESO Headquarters in Garching (Germany). In order to better
show the interesting features, they are all reproduced in false
colours.

<p>

The comet was 0.222 AU (33.2 million km) from the Earth and 1.165 AU
(174 million km) from the Sun at the time of these observations. At
this geocentric distance, 1 arcsec corresponds to 161 km. The nominal
angular resolution, as indicated by the seeing, was about 110
kilometres projected at the distance of the comet.

<p>

The comet was moving at a speed of about 600 arcsec/hour in the sky
and it was not possible to use the automatic guider.  Instead, the NTT
was set to perform blind tracking at the rate of the cometary motion.
During each exposure, i.e. in 2 seconds, the comet moved 0.5 arcsec in
the sky. The advantage of using a large telescope like the NTT for
this type of observation is not only its intrinsically good imaging
quality, but in particular that enough light to show even faint
details may be collected in very short time, thereby avoiding
additional image smearing because of the motion during the exposure.

<p>

The first image, <a
href="http://www.eso.org/educnpubrelns/phot-25a-96.gif"><b>ESO Press
Photo 25a/96 [GIF,33k]</b></a>, shows a combined image, based on 24
R-frames with a total exposure of 48 seconds. It shows the asymmetric
shape of the coma contours (isophotes), indicating the presence of
much structural detail in the coma. The frame measures 145 x 145
arcsec; 1 pixel = 0.128 arcsec. North is up and East is to the left.
The distance between the two components of a close double star, best
seen in the upper right part of the image, is 1.9 arcsec. The multiple
images of the same star is caused by the combination of several frames
- this also shows the comet's very large rate of motion.

<p>

For the further analysis, a comparison was made of two series of 12
R-frames each, obtained at mean epochs 19.342 and 19.363, that is with
a 30-min interval. <a
href="http://www.eso.org/educnpubrelns/phot-25b-96.gif"><b>ESO Press
Photo 25b/96 [GIF,43k]</b></a> and <a
href="http://www.eso.org/educnpubrelns/phot-25c-96.gif"><b>ESO Press
Photo 25c/96 [GIF,43k]</b></a>  show the
asymmetric components of these two, combined frames. They have been
produced by subtracting the corresponding radially averaged frames,
thus leaving only asymmetrical features behind. The field shown in
these frames is 60 x 60 arcsec, i.e. about 10,000 km square at the
distance of the comet. On these frames, 1 pixel = 0.064 arcsec.

<p>

In both frames, a straight ion tail is seen at p.a. 276 (towards West,
i.e. right); it is noticeable at only 0.7 arcsec (115 km projected)
from the peak of light (within which the nucleus is presumed to be located).

<p>

Strong dust jets are also visible. They trace the ejection of dust
particles from the surface of the cometary nucleus. Of particular
interest is the fact that there are substantial morphological changes
on arcsec scale within the short time interval between these
exposures. This is well brought out on a `differential' frame that has
been obtained by subtracting the frame from the later epoch from that
of the earlier one (<a
href="http://www.eso.org/educnpubrelns/phot-25d-96.gif"><b>ESO Press
Photo 25d/96 [GIF,216k]</b></a> and, in a smaller version <a
href="http://www.eso.org/educnpubrelns/phot-25d-96-small.gif"><b>[GIF,54k]</b></a>).

<p>

On this false-colour photo, black areas are where the intensity is
strongest in the first image (25b-96), and red where it is so in the
second image (25c-96).  In addition to a well indicated clockwise
rotation of approx. 20 deg, there are also apparent changes in the jet
structure; for instance, there seems to be more such structures in the
first frame than in the second. By careful comparison, these
differences can be perceived directly on the combined frames also.
