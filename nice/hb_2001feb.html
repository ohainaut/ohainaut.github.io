Hale-Bopp</b>, still active at a distance of nearly 2,000 million
kilometres from the Sun. The photo is a colour composite of several
exposures in different wavebands, obtained with the <a
href="http://www.ls.eso.org/lasilla/Telescopes/2p2T/E2p2M/WFI/"><b>Wide-Field
Imager (WFI)</b></a> camera at the <a
href="http://www.ls.eso.org/lasilla/Telescopes/2p2T/E2p2M/"><b>MPG/ESO
2.2-m telescope</b></a> at the <a href="http://www.ls.eso.org/"><b>La
Silla Observatory</b></a>. Despite the very large distance from the
Sun, the comet is still "active" - it continues to lose material, as
demonstrated by the curved jet, and also possesses an enormous
coma. The broad, fan-shaped extension in the tail direction (to the
upper left) measures at least 2 million kilometres, cf. <b>PR Photo
07b/01</b>, in which the image of the comet has been enhanced to show
these faintest parts better. The frames on which this photo is based
were obtained during three nights (February 27 - March 2, 2001). As
the comet moved in the meantime, there are several images of each star
in the field - they appear multi-coloured, according to the optical
filters that were used. <a href="#techinfo">Technical information</a> about these photos is available below.</small></p></td> </tr> </table>  <h3>A famous comet</h3>  <p>When <b>Comet Hale-Bopp</b> passed through the inner solar system
in early 1997, it was admired in the sky by a substantial fraction of
the world's population.</p>  <p>It was the true image of a "classical" comet, with a bright head
and an enormous, multi-coloured tail. Due to its fortuitous orbit, it
remained visible in the evening sky during several months, with all
the associated positive effects. Professional observers at large
telescopes around the world gathered the richest data ever obtained
from a single comet, amateurs at star parties in different countries
made large numbers of beautiful images and hardly a day passed without
media reports about the latest developments of this spectacular
celestial phenomenon. It is no wonder that, as an extra bonus, the
general interest in astronomy received a major boost on this
occasion.</p>  <p>ESO has maintained a <a
href="../../info-events/hale-bopp"><b>special Hale-Bopp
webpage</b></a> during the past years; from here there are also links
to other Hale-Bopp sites; note, however, that some of them may not be
active anymore.</p>  <h3>The new ESO image</h3>  <p>Since the passage four years ago, the comet has been moving away
from the Sun and is now located at a distance that corresponds to
nearly midway between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. However, as the
comet's orbit is highly inclined to the main plane in which the major
planets move, <b>Hale-Bopp</b> is now far below that plane. It is seen
deep in the southern sky, south of the <i>Large Magellanic Cloud</i> in the constellation Dorado (The Goldfish). It can therefore only be
observed with telescopes located in the southern hemisphere.</p>  <p>As it moves away, observations are made from time to time to
document the comet's behaviour. The large 'dirty snowball' nucleus of
ice and dust (probably about 50 km diameter) continues to be active,
despite the very low temperature where it is now. This is quite
unusual for a comet and is clearly confirmed on the present photo
(<b>PR Photo 07a/01</b>) from the <b>WFI</b> camera on the <b>MPG/ESO
2.2-m</b> telescope at La Silla, obtained a few days ago. The comet
was about 1950 million kilometres (13.0 AU) from the Sun (and about
1965 milion km from the Earth).</p>  <h3>Persistent activity</h3>  <p><b>Hale-Bopp</b> still has the prominent, curved jet-like structure
in the coma that has been observed earlier. No changes in this
structure were observed during the three nights of observation. The
jet consists of dust (and gas) escaping from the nucleus. It shines in
reflected sunlight, as does the rest of the coma and also the very
broad, fan-shaped 'tail' (<b>PR Photo 07b/01</b>; towards the upper
left). The total size of the comet is still a staggering 2 million
kilometres, or about five times the distance between the Earth and the
Moon.</p>  <p>Another famous comet, <b>Halley</b>, was found in 1991 to have a
significant coma at about the same distance from the Sun. However,
while <b>Halley</b> apparently underwent a major, short-lived
outburst, possibly because of a collision with a piece of rock or ice,
<b>Hale-Bopp</b> has been steadily emitting dust and gas all the time
since the perihelion passage four years ago. Most astronomers believe
that this unusual state must in some way be connected to the
exceptionally large size of its nucleus, but the details are not
known.</p>  <h3>Hale-Bopp observations still during many years</h3>  <p>Astronomers at ESO and elsewhere will continue to follow
<b>Hale-Bopp</b> as long as possible, perhaps during the next several
decades. It is still relatively bright (magnitude 14.5, or about 2500
times fainter than what can be seen with the unaided eye in a dark
sky). It is now moving outwards at a speed of about 11 km/sec, or 1
million km per day. It will be interesting to see how long the
present, highly unusual activity continues.</p>  <h4><a name="techinfo">Technical information about the photos</a></h4> <small><p><b>PR Photo 07a/01</b> is based on 14 individual exposures
with the <b>WFI</b>, obtained during three nights from February 27 to
March 2, 2001. They comprised 6 R-frames (each of 180 sec exposure), 6
V-frames (180 sec) and 2 B-frames (240 sec), totalling 44 min exposure
time.  The image covers about 5.1 x 3.5 arcmin<sup>2</sup>, i.e. only
a small part of the original 8192 x 8192 pix<sup>2</sup> WFI frame
(0.24 arcsec/pix; 34 arcmin across).  <b>PR Photo 07b/01</b> is a
reproduction of the combined R-frames (18 min exposure) that has been
'stretched' to better show the faintest details of the coma and
fan-shaped 'tail'. The field measures about 6 x 6 arcmin<sup>2</sup>.
North is up, and East is left in both photos. The observers were ESO
astronomers <i>Olivier Hainaut</i> and <i>Audrey Delsanti</i> who
obtained these data during a short period before the objects of their
main programme became observable.</p></small>  <h3>Contact</h3>  <p><i>Olivier Hainaut</i><br> ESO-Chile<br> email: <a href="mailto:ohainaut@eso.org">ohainaut@eso.org</a>  <hr size="3">  <p><b>ESO PR Photos 07a-b/01</b> may be reproduced, if credit is given
