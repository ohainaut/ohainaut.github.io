<h2>New Image of Comet Halley in the Cold</h2>

<h3>VLT Observes Famous Traveller at Record Distance</h3>

<i><p><b>Summary</b></p>

<p>Seventeen years after the last passage of <b>Comet Halley</b>, the
<a href="../../info-events/ut1fl/"><b>ESO Very Large Telescope</b></a>
at Paranal (Chile) has captured a unique image of this famous object
as it cruises through the outer solar system. It is completely
inactive in this cold environment.</p>

<p>No other comet has ever been observed this far - 4200 million km
from the Sun - or that faint - nearly 1000 million times fainter than
what can be perceived with the unaided eye.</p>

<p>This observation is a byproduct of a dedicated search <a
href="#note1">[1]</a> for small Trans-Neptunian Objects, a population
of icy bodies of which more than 600 have been found during the past
decade.</p></i>

<p>Remember <a
href="http://cometography.com/pcomets/001p.html"><b>Comet
Halley</b></a> - the famous "haired star" that has been observed with
great regularity - about once every 76 years - during more than two
millennia?  Which was visited by an international spacecraft armada
when it last passed through the inner solar system in 1986? And which
put on a fine display in the sky at that time?</p>

<p>Now, 17 years after that passage, this cosmic traveller has again
been observed at the European Southern Observatory. Moving outward
along its elongated orbit into the deep-freeze outer regions of the
solar system, it is now almost as far away as Neptune, the most
distant giant planet in our system. At 4,200 million km from the Sun,
Comet Halley has now completed four-fifths of its travel towards the
most distant point of this orbit. As the motion is getting ever
slower, it will reach that turning point in December 2023, after which
it begins its long return towards the next passage through the inner
solar system in 2062.</p>

<p>The new image of Halley was taken with the Very Large Telescope
(VLT) at Paranal (Chile); a "cleaned" version is shown in <b>PR Photo
27a/03</b>. It was obtained as a byproduct of an observing program
aimed at studying the population of icy bodies at the rim of the solar
system. The image shows the raven-black, 10-km cometary nucleus of ice
and dust as an unresolved faint point of light, without any signs of
activity.</p>

<h3>A cold and inactive "dirty snowball"</h3> 

<p>The brightness of the comet was measured as visual magnitude V =
28.2, or nearly 1000 million times fainter than the faintest objects
that can be perceived in a dark sky with the unaided eye.</p>

<p>The pitch black nucleus of Halley reflects about 4% of the
sunlight; it is a very "dirty" snowball indeed. We know from the
images obtained by the <a
href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=15">ESA
Giotto spacecraft</a> in 1986 that it is avocado-shaped and on the
average measures about 10 km diameter across. The VLT observation is
therefore equivalent to seeing a 5-cm piece of coal at a distance of
20,500 km (about the distance between the Earth's poles) and to do so
in the evening twilight. This is because at the large distance of
Comet Halley, the infalling sunlight is 800 times fainter than here on
Earth.</p>

<p>The measured brightness of the cometary image perfectly matches
that expected for the nucleus alone, taking into account the distance,
the solar illumination and the reflectivity of the surface. This shows
that all cometary activity has now ceased. The nucleus is now an inert
ball of ice and dust, and is likely to remain so until it again
returns to the solar neighbourhood, more than half a century from now.

<h3>A record observation</h3>

<p>At 28.06 AU heliocentric distance (1 AU = 149,600,000 km - the mean
distance between the Earth and the Sun), this is by far the most
distant observation ever made of a comet <a href="#note2">[2]</a>.  It
is also the faintest comet ever detected (by a factor of about 5); the
previous record, magnitude 26.5, was co-held by comet Halley at 18.8
AU (with the ESO New Technology Telescope in 1994) and Comet Sanguin
at 8.5 AU (with the Keck II telescope in 1997).</p>

<p>Interestingly, when Comet Halley reaches its largest distance from
the Sun in December 2023, about 35 AU, it will only be 2.5 times
fainter than it is now. The comet would still have been detected
within the present exposure time. This means that with the VLT, for
the first time in the long history of this comet, the astronomers now
possess the means to observe it at any point in its 76-year orbit!</p>

<h3>A census of faint Transneptunian Objects</h3>

<p>The image of Halley was obtained by combining a series of exposures
obtained simultaneously with three of the 8.2-m telescopes (ANTU,
MELIPAL and YEPUN) during 3 consecutive nights with the main goal to
count the number of small icy bodies orbiting the Sun beyond Neptune,
known as Transneptunian Objects (TNOs). Since the discovery of the
first TNO in 1992, more than 600 have been found, most of these
measuring several hundred km across. The VLT observations aim at a
census of smaller TNOs - the incorporation of the sky field with Comet
Halley allows verification of the associated, extensive data
processing. Similar TNO-surveys have been performed before, but this
is the first time that several very large telescopes are used
simultaneously in order to observe extremely faint, hitherto
inaccessible objects.</p>

<p>The VLT observations will provide very useful information about the
frequency of (smaller) TNOs of different sizes and thereby,
indirectly, about the rate of collisions they have suffered since
their formation. This study will also cast more light on the mystery
of the apparent "emptiness" of the very distant solar system.  Why are
so few objects found beyond 45 AU? It is not known whether this is
because there are no objects out there or if they are simply too small
or too dark, or both, to have been detected so far.</p>

<p>The combination of the images from three 8.2-m telescopes obtained
during three consecutive nights is not straightforward. The individual
characteristics of the imaging instruments (FORS1 on ANTU, VIMOS on
MELIPAL and FORS2 on YEPUN) must be taken into account and corrected.
Moreover, the motion of the very faint moving objects has to be
compensated for, even though they are too faint to be seen on
individual exposures; they only reveal themselves when several (many!)
frames are combined during the final steps of the process. It is for
this reason that the presence of a known, faint object like Comet
Halley in the field-of-view provides a powerful control of the data
processing. If Halley is visible at the end, it has been done
properly. The extensive data processing is now under way and the
intensive search for new Transneptunian objects has started.

<p>The field with Comet Halley was observed with the giant telescopes
during each of three consecutive nights, yielding 81 individual
exposures with a total exposure time of almost 9 hours.</p>

<p>The faint comet is completely invisible on the individual
images. On <b>PR Photo 27b/03</b>, these frames have been added
directly, showing very faint stars and galaxies. Also this photo does
not show the moving comet, but by shifting the frames before they are
added in such a way that the comet remains fixed, a faint image does
emerge among the stellar trails, cf. <b>PR Photo 27c/03</b>.</p>

<p>A better, but much more cumbersome method is to "subtract" the
images of all stars and galaxies from the individual exposures, before
they are added. <b>PR Photo 27a/03</b> has been produced in this way
and shows the image of Comet Halley more clearly. In total, about
20,000 photons were detected from the comet, i.e. about one photon per
8.2-m telescope every 1.6 second. However, during the same time, the
telescopes collected about one thousand times more photons from
molecular emission in the Earth's atmosphere within the sky area
covered by the comet's image. The presence of this considerable
"noise" calls for very careful image processing in order to detect the
faint comet signal.

<p>The identity of the comet is beyond doubt: the image is faintly
visible on composite photos obtained during a single night,
demonstrating that the direction and rate of motion of the detected
object perfectly matches that predicted for Comet Halley from its
well-known orbit. Moreover, the image is located within 1 arcsec from
the predicted position in the sky.</p>

<h3>Outlook</h3>

<p>After its passage in 1910, Comet Halley was again seen in 1982,
when <i>David Jewitt</i> first observed its faint image with the 5-m
Palomar telescope at a time when it was 11 AU from the Sun, a little
further than planet Saturn. It was observed from La Silla two months
later. As the comet approached, the ice in the nucleus began to
evaporate (sublimate), and the comet soon became surrounded by a cloud
of dust and gas (the "coma"). It developed the tail that is typical of
comets and was extensively observed, also from several spacecraft
passing close to its nucleus in early 1986.</p>

<p>Observations have since been made of Comet Halley as it moves away
from the Sun, documenting a steady decrease of activity. When it
reached the distance of Saturn, the tail and coma had disappeared
completely, leaving only the 5 x 5 x 15 km avocado-shaped "dirty
snowball" nucleus. However, Halley was still good for a major
surprise: in 1991, a gigantic explosion happened, providing it with an
expanding, extensive cloud of dust for several months. It is not known
whether this event was caused by a collision with an unknown piece of
rock or by internal processes (a last "sigh" on the way out).</p>

<p>Until now, the most recent observation of Comet Halley was done in
1994 with the New Technology Telescope (NTT) at La Silla, at that time
the most powerful ESO telescope. It showed the comet to be completely
inactive. Nine years later, so does the present VLT observation. It is
unlikely that any activity will be seen until this famous object again
approaches the Sun, more than 50 years from now.

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p><a name="note1">[1]</a>: The Halley image was obtained during a
study of faint Transneptunian Objects, conducted by a team of
astronomers lead by <i>Olivier Hainaut</i> (ESO-Chile) and including
<i>Audrey C. Delsanti</i> (ESO-Chile and Paris Observatory, Meudon),
<i>Daisuke Kinoshita</i> (ESO-Chile and National Astronomical
Observatory, Japan) <i>Karen J. Meech</i> (Institute for Astronomy,
University of Hawaii, Honolulu, USA), <i>Emanuela Pompei</i>
(ESO-Chile) and <i>Richard West</i> (ESO-Garching).</p>

<p><a name="note2">[2]</a>: The previous, most distant cometary
observation was that of comet Shoemaker 1987H1 (at 20 AU from the Sun)
with the Keck-2 telescope on Mauna Kea (Hawaii, USA), obtained by
<i>Karen Meech</i> and collaborators in 1997. It revealed that this
comet - following its first passage ever near the Sun - still
displayed some cometary activity this far away.</p>
