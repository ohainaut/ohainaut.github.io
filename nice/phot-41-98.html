<h2>First Rotation Period of a Kuiper Belt Object Measured <a

<h3>News from ESO Workshop on Minor Bodies in the Outer Solar
System</h3>

<p>An <a href="http://www.eso.org"><b>ESO Workshop on Minor Bodies in
the Outer Solar System (ESO MBOSS-98)</b></a> was held at the ESO
Headquarters in Garching, Germany, during November 2-5, 1998. Among
these objects, the newly discovered <b>Kuiper Belt Objects (KBO's)</b>
outside the orbit of planet Neptune (also known as Trans-Neptunian
Objects) are of particular interest, but the meeting was also
concerned with distant comets and some of the small moons of the outer
planets.</p>

<p>During these four days, about 50 specialists from all parts of the
world, observers as well as theoreticians, had a very fruitful
discussion about this rapidly expanding research field. In particular,
they identified some of the crucial questions for which answers are
required in order to advance our overall picture of the formation,
evolution and interaction of these distant bodies. Specific plans were
made for collaborative studies of the outer Solar System during the
coming years.</p>

<p>The workshop served to review and discuss current knowledge of all
minor bodies beyond the asteroid belt, as well as their origins and
inter-relationships. Special emphasis was placed on the optimal use of
next-generation observational facilities, such as the <a
href="http://www.eso.org/outreach/info-events/ut1fl/"><i>ESO Very
Large Telescope (VLT)</i></a> at the <a
href="http://www.eso.org/paranal/"><i>Paranal Observatory
(Chile)</i></a> and the <a
href="http://astro.caltech.edu/mirror/keck/index.html"><i>Keck
telescope</i></a> at Mauna Kea (Hawaii, USA). The participants
enthusiastically identified several front-line observational
investigations that will take full advantage of these powerful
astronomical facilities.</p>

<h3>Kuiper Belt Objects</h3>

<p>The <b>Kuiper Belt</b> is a zone outside the orbits of Neptune and
Pluto in which icy solar system objects were expected to be present;
the first was found in 1992. Since then, more than 70 KBO's have been
found in orbits between approximately 30 AU and 50 AU from the Sun
(4.5 to 7.5 &middot; 10<sup>9</sup> km). One of them (designated
<b>1996 TL66</b>) even reaches a distance of 135 AU (20 &middot;
10<sup>9</sup> km, i.e. 4.5 times the heliocentric distance of
Neptune) when it is farthest away. It is estimated that there may be
at least 100,000 KBO's larger than 100 km.</p>

<p>These objects probably represent the remnants of a much larger
population of such objects, formed in the early phase of the solar
system, some 4.5 billion years ago. Gravitational effects from the
outer planets Neptune and Uranus and collisions soon reduced their
numbers. The outermost planet <b>Pluto</b> is most probably the
largest member of this class of objects.</p>

<p>Because of their large distance, and despite their significant
size, 100 - 500 km diameter, they are all very faint and can only be
observed with large telescopes. Except for their orbits, little is
known about most of them, although recent observations have shown that
they have different colours, ranging from rather blueish to red.</p>

<p>According to current ideas, the short period comets observed in the
inner solar system come from the Kuiper Belt and their kilometre-size
"dirty snowball" nuclei are simply small KBO's.</p>

<h3>First rotational period of a KBO measured at La Silla</h3>

<p>Among the highlights of this workshop was the presentation of a
detailed portrait of a Kuiper-Belt Object, designated as <b>1996
TO66</b>. It was discovered in October 1996 by a group of astronomers
from the University of Hawaii, during a survey aimed at discovering
KBO's. It is one of the brightest trans-neptunian objects known to
date; its magnitude is 21.2, i.e. it is about 1.5 million times
fainter than the faintest stars visible by naked eye.</p>

<p>A group of European astronomers <a href="#note1">[2]</a> used the
<a
href="http://www.ls.eso.org/lasilla/Telescopes/NEWNTT/NTT-MAIN.html"><i>ESO
3.6-m New Technology Telescope (NTT)</i></a> at the <a
href="http://www.ls.eso.org/"><i>La Silla observatory</i></a> during 6
nights in August and October 1997 to obtain very accurate observations
of <b>1996 TO66</b>, while is was at a distance of about 45 AU.</p>

shows a composite image of the Kuiper Belt Object <b>1996 TO66</b>
(round image at the center), totalling 4 hours of exposure with the
EMMI multi-mode instrument at the 3.6-m New Technology Telescope (NTT)
at La Silla. During the exposure, the object moved with respect to the
background stars; this motion was compensated for and the KBO
therefore appears as a point, while the images of background stars are
trailed. The bright, nearly horizontal line that crosses the entire
field is the light trail left by a geostationary satellite in orbit
around the Earth, that crossed the field of view during one of the
exposures (this also serves to illustrate a specific problem of modern
astronomy - that of increasing "light pollution" from artificial
satellites illuminated by the Sun). The lower panel is the composite
"light-curve" of <b>1996 TO66</b>, showing its brightness ("red
magnitude") variations with time (in hours). The dots and the
corresponding "error bars" represent the actual measurements from
several nights and their uncertainties, while the solid line is a
mathematic fit through these points. It was used to determine the
rotation period of <b>1996 TO66</b> as about 6 hours and 15
minutes.</small></p>

<p>During these nights, they took over 50 images of the object through
different optical filters; on each of these, they carefully measured
its brightness. The resulting "light-curve", cf. <b>ESO PR Photo
41/98</b>, i.e. the change of brightness with time, shows a clear
variation with a period of a little over 6 hours. This is caused by
rotation of the object. It is the first time it has been possible to
determine a rotation period of any KBO.</p>

<p>From the mean brightness of <b>1996 TO66</b>, it was estimated that
the diameter is of the order of 600 km. This corresponds to just under
one third of the size of the outermost planet Pluto, making <b>1996
TO66</b> one of the largest known KBO's. The light-curve also
indicates that the object is somewhat elongated (one axis is at least
10% larger than the others), and that the surface may possibly have
some darker and brighter regions.</p>

<h3>Implications</h3>

<p>This first measurement of the rotation period of a KBO is
important: as <b>1996 TO66</b> is a comparatively large body, it is
most likely that the rotation period has not changed much since its
formation, 4.5 billion years ago. This is one more precious piece of
information to our still very sparse knowledge about the processes
that took place when our solar system was formed. Interestingly,
<b>(2060) Chiron</b>, a minor planet in orbit between Saturn and
Uranus that is thought to have originally come from the Kuiper Belt,
also rotates with a period near 6 hours.</p>

<p>A comparison of <b>1996 TO66</b>'s brightness as measured through
different optical filters, indicates that it is of a grey-blue colour,
similar to that of Pluto's moon, <b>Charon</b>, and also the KBO <b>1996
TL66</b>.</p>

<p>Very little is still known about the physical nature of the KBO's.
They are so remote and faint that their study, even with large
telescopes, is near the observational limits of what is
possible. Nevertheless, new results like these now pave the way
towards a better understanding of the current population of minor
bodies in the outer reaches of our solar system.</p>

<p>When more observations of KBO's with large telescopes like the VLT
become available during the next years, it is expected that trends in
their measured physical properties (e.g. rotational state, surface
properties) will emerge. This will in turn permit more specific
conclusions about the structure of the proto-planetary disk and the
processes by which the planets and the KBO's were formed.</p>
