The Education and Public Outreach Department at ESO's Headquarters in
Garching near Munich, Germany, is offering an opportunity to work with




<h1>Astronomical image retouching</h1>

<p>You will be working with astronomical data from some of the worldâ€™
s most advanced telescopes, such as ESO's Very Large Telescope and
the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, as part of the production of
stunning and beautiful images of the Universe. 

<p>Astronomical data go through various steps before resulting in a
publication-ready image such as those appearing in magazines.  One of
the steps is performed in Photoshop. It consists in removing all the
defects, artifacts and blemishes that are present in the raw data and
do not come from the astronomical objects.



<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some knowledge of image cleaning 
<li>Work with Photoshop (not Elements nor GIMP, for compatibility issues)
<li>Patience 
<li>Some knowledge of, or interest in, astronomy may be useful but is not necessary

</ul>


<h2>Job description</h2>

<p>We estimate that this job will take 20 to 25 hours depending on
  experience. 


<p>Your task is to remove defects from all the layers in a PSD
  file. The defects to be cleaned out are described in 
 <b><a href="imageProc.html">this document</a></b>; clean out all
  those matching the defects in Section 2.1 (and only these):
<ul>
<li>a.- Bad columns and traps
<li>b.- Stuff on the detector
<li>c.- Cosmic rays
<li>d.- Saturation bleeds
<li>e.- Over saturation dot
<li>f.- Satellite streaks
</ul>

<p>Do not clean other issues you find that are not in this list  (the other sections in the document are for background information only).

<p>A small example PSD file (470Mb!) is available
in <a href="example.psd">example.psd</a>. The actual file will be
provided by the responsible person at ESO and may have a size of
between 1 and 2 GB.

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>
You are requested to submit a partially completed file for evaluation
(PSD or full-res jpg, save-for-web, quality 80) after about every 5
hours of work and will receive feedback on the progress.

<h2>Delivery</h2>
<p>The partially cleaned files, as well as the final PSD, must be
transferred via anonymous ftp to ftp.eso.org, in directory
incoming/general/outreach
(ftp://ftp.eso.org/incoming/general/outreach/ but note that the
directory cannot be read from outside of ESO).  The files must be
named <t>xxxx_NN_date.psd</t> where xxxx is the original name, NN are
your initials, and date is the date of the file, for instance
<t>eagle_OH_2009-05-21.psd</t>. 

<p>When transferring a file to the ftp
server, send a note to ohainaut at eso.org announcing it.





<h2>Remarks</h2>
We have many other images in the pipeline.
