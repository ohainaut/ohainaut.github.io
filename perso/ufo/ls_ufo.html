<h1>Russian UFO over La Silla</h1>


<p>On January 23, 1992, a very uncommon object passed over Chile; It
was seen by thousands of people, from Villa O'Higgins (2100km South of
Santiago) to Copiapo (700km North of Santiago, and 200 from the ESO La
Silla Observatory).  Journalists from <i>El Mercurio</i> (the major
Chilean newspaper) described the phenomenon as <i>"a luminous cloud
moving northward, from which suddenly grew a mushroom, like that of an
atomic explosion,"</i> and <i>"similar to a spaceship with a tail,
like the one of a comet"</i>!

<p>The object flew over La Silla around 23h20, and was seen by many of
the observers and night assistants; the following description was
compiled from their testimonies:
<ul>
<li> 23h15: A small luminous ring with diameter of about 0.5deg is
    seen at West-South-West, at about 25deg over the horizon, moving
    slowly northward.
<li> 23h15-23h20: A small, sharp and bright object moves slowly, the
    ring expands to 5deg in diameter, and a huge "cone" (40deg long,
    20deg wide) follows the object.
<li> 23h20-23h21: it suddenly accelerates and moves rapidly to the
    West-North-Westm 45 deg above the horizon. The main object becomes
    very bright (brighter than Venus), remains sharp and is surrounded
    by a small (1/4-1/3deg) ring (as seen with binoculars). It then
    becomes more and more diffuse and very quickly fades away.
</ul>

<p>Eric Aubourg, observing at the GPO telescope, took the following
pictures:

<i>Enlargement from 10 seconds exposure around 23h18 (TMax 400 film,
    Leica camera and 35mm lens). The object is seen surrounded by the
    ring, which is elongated by the motion of during the exposure, and
    is followed by the cone. This image is also available as a  
    <a href="ls_ufo1.jpg">larger</a> JPG file (224kO).

<i>1 minute exposure, from 23h20-21 (same technical parameters). This
    images is a scan of the entire negative. To the left, the remains
    of the cone are seen, and to the right the object is fading away,
    and finally disappears. To the left, the black, almost vertical
    lines are the image of a meteorological tower.This image is also
    available as a <a href="ls_ufo2.jpg">larger</a> JPG file
    (408kO).</I>

<p> It should be noted that in Chile, and especially in the region of
    Elqui (where La Silla is), there is a strong tradition of seeing
    UFO. A large community of post-hippies has been established in the
    Elqui Valley, and tells many stories of UFOs. The Elqui valley is
    considered (by them) as a very powerful place, where the energies
    are flowing in a very abundant way. It is hypothesized (again, by
    them) that this is related to the geographical position of that
    valley, exactly at the opposite of Katmandu. The change of Era
    (from Pisces to Aquarius) caused an invertion in the energy field
    of the Earth, establishing the spirituality center in its new
    location. It should also be added that the Elqui Valley is very
    rural (therefore its night sky is very dark) and constitute
    a very good observing site. Moreover, the Elqui Valley is the
    place where most of the Chilean pisco (grape alcohol) is produced.


<p>Using these observations described here, R.Rast (NASA) and
    N.Johnson (Kaman Science), could identify the object. One hour
    earlier, the Commonwealth of Independent States has launched
    Cosmos 2176 on a 3-stage rocket from Plesetsk (2300km NW from
    BAikonur). The strap on and zero-stage impacted within CIS
    borders. The first stage placed the payload and second stage into
    a transfer orbit of roughly 200x600km. After separationm the first
    stace remains in transfer orbit, and the second stage fires while
    heading North-East of the West coast of South-America, before
    completing one revolution of the Earth. Until these pictures,
    there was speculation whether this type of UFO seen by Chileans
    was the first stage venting unburned fuel or the second stage
    firing. In this case, the latter explanation is correct: a nominal
    second stage burn lasts a little under 4 minutes. The mission
    Cosmos 2176 was to detect (in the infrared) the launch of missiles
    toward the CIS.
