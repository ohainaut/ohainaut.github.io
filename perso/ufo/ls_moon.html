<H1>January 1992, La Silla Observatory, Chile</H1>

<p><i>"A *huge* object, extremely bright, was seen taking off from the
mountains behind the the European Southern Observatory telescopes at
La Silla"</i>

<p> This is a long exposure (about 2h) of the rising moon (brightest
trail). All the other colored trails result from multiple reflections
in the 28mm Minolta lens that was used. The clouds at the horizon are
typical for that period of the year, they always hang on the summit of
the Andes. If you have a good monitor, you can also see the very sharp
trails left by some stars. The reddish, lava-like zig-zag trails on
the right-hand side of the foreground are left by the light of cars
moving between the telescopes.
