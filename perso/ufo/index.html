<H1>Identified UFOs and other Mysterious Flying Objects</H1>

<p>Being an astronomer, one of the most frequently question I am asked is
"Do you believe in UFOs?" or some variation around that theme. The
short answer is YES, I do. I do believe in "Unidentified Flying
Objects". <B>BUT</B> I do my best to identify them, and once I have
the identification, they are not UFOs anymore. That is the main
difference with fanatic "UFOlogists", who will refuse any explanation
that goes against a alien origin of the UFO.

<p>The next question is usually "have you seen any UFO?" Again, yes.
Spending many night outside, watching the sky, it is almost
unavoidable. I even took pictures of some of them.  Untill now, I
always found an non-alien explanation.  Here is a sample of my
collection, it should be growing when I have time to scan them.
